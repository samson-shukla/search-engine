# SearchEnjin🔍
As the name suggests (not a very creative one though), this project is about building a Search Engine like Google or Brave Search. 

The main goal of this project is to practice ReactJs, learn how to use APIs and Tailwind CSS.

Till now --> Built Navbar, Footer, Results, Search & Loading components, ResultContextProvider.js (to fetch the results from Google API), enabled the Light/Dark mode switch and styled a little bit.

The Routes component is not working as of now due to React Router switch from v5 to v6 so implemented the logic in App.js itself, but will fix this issue later.
