## SearchEnjinüîç
****************
###As the name suggests (not a very creative one though), this project is about building a Search Engine like Google or Brave Search. 

The main goal of this project is to practice ReactJs, learn how to use APIs and Tailwind CSS.

The Search results component is working good. Next, I will be implementing Images, Videos and News part.

*The Routes component is not working as of now due to React Router switch from v5 to v6 so implemented the logic in App.js itself, but will fix this issue later.
